## Frontend Project

# Pre-requisit
Before we can start launching this project with either Docker, Github Actions or Locally, it is required to download the latest chromedriver binary file.
Here is the link to the download page: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
Make sure that you download the correct binary file, that is: check your Chrome Browser version and make sure you are installing a chromedriver that supports it.
