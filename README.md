# Automation Portfolio
In this project you will find out my personal portfolio for test automation purposes.
Here I have 2 main project in WIP:
- Web Automation
- API automation

##1. Web Automation:
For the web automation I use the following tecnologies:
- Behave
- Selenium
- Python

###Behave 
[Behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a python framework for automation testing that allows the QA team to implement BDD within the scripts.


###Selenium
[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) Selenium (Webdriver) is the main automation tool for testers which allows the interaction with the web. It has several usages but it main goal is the web automation. 

###Python
As I am using Behave, which is an automation Framework, I use python as my main programming language.

### Web under automation
https://phptravels.com/demo/ is the main page under test.


##2. API Automation:
For the API automation I use:
- Behave
- Request
- Python

### Why Behave for API testing
Why do I use behave for API testing? I strongly believe that it is important to address all our tests cases to everyone, so that understand the product under testing as well as its behavior. 

### Request
Request is the main library for api calls integrated with python.

### API under automation 
https://petstore.swagger.io/ is the swagger for the API testing
