# Automation Portfolio
In this project you will find out my personal portfolio for test automation purposes.
Here I have 2 main project in WIP:
- Web Automation
- API automation

## 1. Web Automation:
For the web automation I use the following tecnologies:
- Behave
- Selenium
- Python

### Behave 
[Behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a python framework for automation testing that allows the QA team to implement BDD within the scripts.


### Selenium
[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) Selenium (Webdriver) is the main automation tool for testers which allows the interaction with the web. It has several usages but it main goal is the web automation. 

### Python
As I am using Behave, which is an automation Framework, I use python as my main programming language.
